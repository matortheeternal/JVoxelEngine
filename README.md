Mandelcraft
===========

mandel.js is a script for use with WorldEdit.  Simply install it in the plugins\WorldEdit\craftscripts folder for your Minecraft server, and badabing, badaboom - fractals at your fingertips.

Documentation is not yet complete, as this is still pretty beta.  If you have any questions feel free to shoot me a message on the Github or on one of the many forums I am a member of.
